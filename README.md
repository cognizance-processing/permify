## What is Permify?
[Permify](https://permify) is an **open-source authorization service** for creating and maintaining fine-grained authorizations in your applications.

With Permify you can easily structure your authorization model, store authorization data in your own servers securely, and interact with Permify API to handle all authorization questions from any of your applications.

Permify's data model is inspired by Google‚Äôs consistent, global authorization system, [Google Zanzibar Paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/41f08f03da59f5518802898f68730e247e23c331.pdf).

**Looking for Permify Managed Service?** See our [pricing plans](https://permify.co/pricing/1).

## Key Features

üõ°Ô∏è **Production ready** authorization API that serve as **gRPC** and **REST**

üîÆ Domain Specific Authorization Language - Permify Schema - to **easily model** your authorization

üîê Database Configuration to store your permissions **in house** with **high availability**

‚úÖ Perform access control checks and get answers **down to 10ms** with **parallel graph engine**

üí™ Battle tested, robust **authorization architecture and data model** based on [Google Zanzibar](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/41f08f03da59f5518802898f68730e247e23c331.pdf)

‚öôÔ∏è Create custom permissions for your **tenants**, and manage them in single place with **Multi Tenancy**

‚ö° Analyze **performance and behavior** of your authorization with tracing tools [jaeger], [signoz] or [zipkin]

### Cases that can benefit from Permify

- If you already have an identity/auth solution and want to plug in fine-grained authorization on top of that.
- If you want to create a unified access control mechanism to use across your individual applications.
- If you want to make future-proof authorization system and don't want to spend engineering effort for it.
- If you‚Äôre managing authorization for growing micro-service infrastructure.
- If your authorization logic is cluttering your code base.
- If your data model is getting too complicated to handle your authorization within the service.
- If your authorization is growing too complex to handle within code or API gateway.

## How it works

Permify stores access control relations on a database you choose and performs authorization checks based on the stored relations. We called that database Write Database (WriteDB) and it behaves as a centralized data source for your authorization system. You can model your authorization with Permify's DSL - Permify Schema and perform access checks with a single API call anywhere on your stack.

![Value Chain Schema](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34595361/186108668-4c6cb98c-e777-472b-bf05-d8760add82d2.png)

## QuickStart

You can quickly start Permify on your local with running the docker command below:

```shell
docker run -p 3476:3476 -p 3478:3478  ghcr.io/permify/permify serve
```

This will start Permify with the default configuration options: 
* Port 3476 is used to serve the REST API.
* Port 3478 is used to serve the GRPC Service.
* Authorization data stored in memory.

See [all of the options] that you can use to set up and deploy Permify in your servers.

### Test your connection

You can test your connection with creating an GET request,

```shell
localhost:3476/healthz
```

## Getting Started

- [Set Up & Run Permify Service] in your environment.
- Follow a guide to model your authorization using [Permify Schema].
- See our [playground], build your authorization logic and test it with sample data.
- Take a look at the overview of [Permify API].
- See [our article] to examine Google Zanzibar In A Nutshell.
